### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rolando.

I was lucky enough to get into this software engineering thing a long time ago and I am planning to stay for even longer!

Nowadays, I am based in Switzerland, where I work at Comparis AG, leading a team of Software Engineers in designing and building solutions with TypeScript, Next, React, .NET, Azure and a lot of other tools.
