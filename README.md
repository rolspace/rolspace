### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rolando and I am a software engineer.

I was born and raised in Panama City, Panama ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦, I lived there for many years, but ended up moving elsewhere later in life.

I earned a degree in Computer Science from [Harding University](https://www.harding.edu/academics/colleges-departments/sciences/computer-science) in Searcy, Arkansas, in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

After a few years, I moved to Madrid ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ to get an MBA degree from the Universidad Antonio de Nebrija.
I fell in love with the city and stayed there for several years after graduating.

In 2014, I decided to begin a new adventure and moved to ZÃ¼rich, SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. This country has the most amazing landscapes I have ever seen in my life.
There were many great moments while living there, but, eight years later, I felt it was time to return to Madrid.

Currently, I work with an amazing team of software engineers at [ESW](https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/esw/?offices%5B%5D=4063265002) in Madrid, as an Engineering Manager. We use dotNET, Kafka, Azure, Angular, and a lot of other tools to build high quality software for the future of eCommerce.
