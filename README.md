### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rolando and I am a software engineer.

I was born in Panama City, Panama ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦.

I have a degree in Computer Science from [Harding University](https://www.harding.edu/academics/colleges-departments/sciences/computer-science), located in the state of Arkansas, in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.

After a few years, I moved to the bustling city of Madrid in Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, to obtain an MBA from Universidad Antonio de Nebrija.
I fell in love with the city and lived there for several years after graduating.

In 2014, I decided to begin a new adventure and moved to ZÃ¼rich, SwitzerlandðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. No doubt, it definitely has the most amazing landscapes I have ever seen in my life, but, eight years later, I felt it was time to return to Madrid.

Currently, as a solution architect for [Comparis AG](https://www.comparis.ch/people/jobs), I work remotely to help build technical solutions with an amazing team of software engineers. We use dotNET, React, Next, TypeScript, Azure. Docker, and a lot of other tools to build high quality software.

I have a few personal projects here in GitHub, feel free to check them out! ðŸ’»
