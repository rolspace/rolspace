### Hello! 👋

I'm Rolando.

I was lucky enough to get into this Software Engineering thing a long time ago and I am not planning to stop anytime soon 😏

Born and raised in Panama 🇵🇦, I got my Computer Science degree in the US 🇺🇸 and I also lived for a while in Spain. 

These days I live in Switzerland🇨🇭 and  I work at Comparis AG, where I lead an amazing team of software engineers.
We work with React, Next, TypeScript, .NET, Azure and a lot of other tools.

Here are some of the places where you can find me:
