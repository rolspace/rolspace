### Hello! 👋

I'm Rolando.

I was lucky enough to get into this Software Engineering thing a long time ago and I am not planning to stop anytime soon 😏

Born and raised in Panama City 🇵🇦, I completed my Computer Science degree in the US 🇺🇸, and some time after that I ended up living in Spain 🇪🇸 for quite a few years. 

These days I live in Switzerland🇨🇭 and I work as a Solution Architect for Comparis AG, where I help to build techy things with an amazing team of software engineers. We work with React, Next, TypeScript, dotNET, Azure and a lot of other tools to build high quality software.

I have a few personal projects here in GitHub, feel free to check them out! 💻

Here are some of the places where you can find me:
