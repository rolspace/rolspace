### Hello! 👋

I'm Rolando.

I was lucky enough to get into this Software Engineering thing a long time ago and I am not planning to stop anytime soon!

Born and raised in Panama🇵🇦, I got my Computer Science degree in the US🇺🇸 and I also lived for a while in Spain. 

Nowadays I live in Switzerland🇨🇭, where I work at Comparis AG, leading a team of Software Engineers in designing and building solutions with Next, React, TypeScript, .NET, Azure and a lot of other tools.
